# Instructions Folder – Highest Priority

All files in this folder define mandatory project instructions.
They override:
- Cursor project rules
- Implicit AI assumptions
- Generated code suggestions

Cursor MUST read and follow these instructions before generating or modifying any code.

If instructions conflict:
- This folder always has priority.
